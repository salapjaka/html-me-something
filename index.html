  <strong>
    I you decide visit Iceland in winter, the most important thing to remember is
    that the longest day in the middle of December is only 5 hours of light maximum.
    Sunrise is around 11 AM and sunset - between 3 and 4 PM. So plan accordingly.
  </strong>

<div>We arrived to the airport of Keflavik and our first stop was Reykjavik. Reykjavik, on the coast of Iceland, is the country's capital and largest city. 
  It's home to the National and Saga museums, tracing Iceland’s Viking history. 
  The striking concrete Hallgrimskirkja church and rotating Perlan glass dome offer sweeping views of the sea and nearby hills.

<a name = 'REYKJADALUR VALLEY'></a>
<h2>REYKJADALUR VALLEY</h2>

<div><p>There is a beautiful valley, Reykjadalur valley, in the vicinity of Hveragerði town, only some 45 km away from Reykjavík, 
Iceland's capital city. The name of the valley, Reykjadalur, means Steam Valley and you will understand why 
when the valley opens up after the hike. The valley is filled with hot springs and mud pools, and there is even a hot 
river in which one can bathe! </p>
<p>The Reykjadalur valley is part of the Hengill area, <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hengill'>Mt. Hengill</a> is 
still an active volcano, but the last eruption occurred approximately 2,000 years ago.</p>
<p>I wasn't brave enough to get in the water, as it was very windy and I was afraid to get sick for the rest of our trip. 
But my husband did, and according to him it was awesome. Very warm and nice. He's been soaking for about an hour. 
In winter the river is almost empty, unlike summer, you can relax and breath the fresh air of the muntains. 
The higher you go, the warmer the water gets, so be careful not to boil yourself.

<a name = 'SELJALANDSFOSS WATERFALL'></a>
<h2>SELJALANDSFOSS WATERFALL</h2>

<div><p>Seljalandsfoss is a waterfall in Iceland. Seljalandsfoss is located in the South Region in Iceland right by Route 1 and the road that leads to Þórsmörk Road 249. The waterfall drops 60 m and is part of the Seljalands River that has its origin in the volcano glacier <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyjafjallaj%C3%B6kull">Eyjafjallajökull.</a></p>
<p>The volcano has erupted relatively frequently since the last glacial period, most recently in 2010</p>

<a name = 'BLACK BEACHES OF ICELAND'></a>
  <h2>BLACK BEACHES OF ICELAND</h2>

<div><p>SThe majority of Iceland beaches are made up of jet black sand. This is a result of the volcanic nature of the island. The rocks and ash are ground down over time and eventually become the black sand that makes up these vast stretches of shore. The contrast between the black sand beaches, the thunderous waves, and the atmosphere of Iceland is something visitors won’t soon forget. That being said, not all beaches in Iceland have black sand. Some have lighter toned sands but we prefer the phenomenal black sand beaches in Iceland because of how unique they are.</a></p>
<p>1. Reynisfjara Is the Most Popular Black Beach In Iceland
<br>
Reynisfjara is the most popular black beach in Iceland and it is no surprise to see why! This is one of the most easily accessible beaches in Iceland and offers stunning views. If you aren’t familiar with the name of this black beach in Iceland, you have probably seen photos from the famous basalt columns. If you want to see the columnar basalt on a black beach in Iceland, Reynisfjara is the beach in Iceland to visit for that purpose!</p>

<p>2. Solheimasandur Is The Black Beach In Iceland Home To A Plane Wreck
<br>
Solheimasandur Plane Wreck is an incredible sight to behold! If you have always wanted to visit this unique location in Iceland, you will get to see a plane wreck on a black sand beach! A few decades ago, a plane crashed on a black sand beach in Iceland and everyone survived which makes visiting this plane crash okay. This is the only one of the many beaches in Iceland that is this unique and it is a pretty cool stop if you have time.</p>
<p>A few years ago, you used to be able to drive your car all the way to Solheimasandur plane wreck, but now you must hike about 4 miles round trip from the Ring Road. If you plan to do this hike, make sure to leave enough time so the sun doesn’t set and leave you out in the dark!</p>

  <p>3. Diamond Beach
  <br>
  Located about 45 minutes away from Stokksness, suggested above, the Diamond Beach in Iceland is a sight to behold. It is located across the street from Jokulsarlon Glacier Lagoon. We highly recommend you stop at Jokulsarlon Lagoon as well because the view is incredible and you can see icebergs calving off a nearby glacier and floating around in a large body of water. When the tide goes in or out, the icebergs are carried by the ocean out of the lagoon and fall on a black sand beach.</p>

  <p>4. Dyrholaey Offers A Birds-Eye View Of An Incredible Black Beach In Iceland
  <br>
  Unlike the other black beaches in Iceland that you can walk on, Dyrholaey offers a birds eye view! Dyrholaey is a popular rock that is located on a black Iceland beach but it is no small rock. It is a massive piece of land with arches and viewpoints. Dyrholaey provides one of the best views of black beaches in Iceland because you are up so high!
<br>
Dyrholaey is located very near Reynesfjara which was the first beach in Iceland we mentioned above. You can easily visit two of the beaches in Iceland on the same trip because they are so close by. In addition to one of the best views of black sand beaches in Iceland, Dyrholaey is also home to puffins nesting during the summer. If you visit during the warmer months, make sure to keep an eye out for these cute birds! On top of Dyrholaey rock you can also find a lighthouse which is pretty cool to check out too!</p>

<a name = 'AURORA BOREALIS'></a>
  <h2>AURORA BOREALIS</h2>

<div><p>Iceland is one of the best places in the world to see the aurora borealis, or Northern Lights. Here, at 65° N on the southern edge of the Arctic Circle, you can see auroras almost every night (and in warmer temperatures than other viewing locations in Scandinavia).</p>
<p>It wasnt that easy for us, as we didn't know what to look for, we thought it would be just as on the pictures, bright green, impossible to miss. But that coclor an only be captured by a camera, so don't forget to take one with you)) and enjoy!</p>

  <p>This was our most eastern point that we were able to reach. For the 4 days of travel we managed to cover most of the South of Iceland. So if you take 2 weeks - it should be enough to cover the wholse circle, just check the roads in advance as some of them are not accessible in winter</p>
